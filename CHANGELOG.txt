TimeBox Change Log
------------------

TimeBox 0.10.6: released 2016-Mar-04
- Introduces functions to get information on data sets without the need to load
  the full data: TS.LOADMETA and TS.SAVEMETA handle meta-information within data
  sets, and TS.GETDIM retrieves number of instances and time series length.
- Introduces TS.GETPATH to return the path where a data set file is supposed to
  be stored.
- Allows TS.MAKEFOLDS to make validation folds: you may provide an index over an
  existing fold to obtain a new set of folds constructed on the indexed data.
- Adds TB.SHARPSHOOT to produce SharpShoot plots, and add option -nofigure to
  TB.SCAT. This is useful to use TB.SCAT in subplots.
- Adds TB.MERGECELLS to work with data loaded by TS.LOADFILES: this function
  actually concatenates cells with equal number of rows into a single cell,
  removing rows where any of the original cell had missing data.
- Fixed bugs with TB.SPLITSTRING, TS.GETNAMES, and TS.SAVE. Also improve
  documentation of several functions and some error messages are now more
  informative.

TimeBox 0.9.5: released 2015-Nov-30
- Introduces functions for distance matrix-based ensembles. The functions in
  RUNS.DME implemente the strategies reported in the following paper:
  Giusti, R; Silva, D.F.; and Batista, E.A.P.A. "Time Series Classification
  with Representation Ensembles". Published on 14th International Symposium on
  Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA'2015).
- Adds auxiliary functions to load batches of files and to write data as CSV
  files.


TimeBox 0.8.4: released 2015-Sep-14
- Deprecates the RELEASEDATE field in the version structure. This feature may be
  removed in the future;
- Removes internal documentation from TB.VERSION about unimplemented features:
  the function was supposed to check the presence or absence of flags when
  supplied a second argument.


TimeBox 0.8.3: released 2015-Sep-09
- Introduced functions to cache time series representation: TRANSFORM.CACHE and
  TRANSFORM.ISCACHED.


TimeBox 0.7.2: released 2015-May-19
